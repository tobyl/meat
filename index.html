            <h2 class="title"><span>What?</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">A meatfest. <strong>THE</strong> meatfest. The meatfest to end all meatfests.</p>
            <p>2018 was a simpler time. No pandemic. Russia had only invaded Ukraine once or twice. And the first meat party took place.</p>
            <p>Now it's time for round two. <strong>Meat II: The Porkening</strong> will be a celebration of meat of all kinds.</p>
            <p>More meat. More fire. More tractor. More hot tub. Bring a bathing suit!</p>

            <h2 class="title"><span>Who?</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">If you're reading this, then you. Possibly. It's a public site, so who knows.</p>
            <p>You may have been lucky enough to be present at this first meat party, It'll be a similar crowd, with a few notable additions. Closer to the time I'll make a Facebook group, but in the mean time please <abbr title="Respondez Sil Vous Fucking Plait">RSVFP</abbr> </p>

            <h2 class="title"><span>Where?</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">I'm just gonna rip this band aid off real quick - it's in Cottam, down the road from Essex.</p>
            <p>Why? The simple truth is that only one lesson was learned from the first meatfest: WE NEED MORE SPACE. More space = more meat. You'll have to trust me on that.</p>
            <p>Also, I moved.</p>

            <h2 class="title"><span>When?</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Tentatively, the weekend of August 19th. Cancel all other plans, you're not gonna want to miss this.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h2 class="title"><span>Why?</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Why did America send men to the moon? Because they could.</p>
            <p>Why did Amber Heard shit on Johnny Depp's bed? Because she's a nutjob. Who knows why people do the things they do. We can get into the weeds, or we can eat some meat and drink some beers. I choose the latter.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>I have to drive all the way to Cottam??</h3>
            <p>Yes. You do. Fasten up that diaper and get comfortable with it. It'll be worth it, especially if <strong>YOU</strong> come, treasured invitee.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>A chair. Enough for you to drink to at least get tipsy. A bathing suit. And a colon strong enough to process at least a kilogram of pork and beef.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>I was at the first party and I had some feedback...</h3>
            <p>Of course you do. I put a lot of work into the first party, and 2.0 is shaping up to be even more work. That said, I welcome and respect all feedback - please feel free to direct any feedback to gfy@leftly.me.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>I'm a vegetarian, am I welcome?</h3>
            <p>Hrm. I guess. But if I hear a single preachy comment or see a single disgusted glance, you're outta here!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>I'm a vegan, and I think..</h3>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I have to drive home at the end of the night?</h3>
            <p>We have a ton of space, but not much in the way of spare beds or bedding. If you're interested in crashing, let me know and we can figure something out.</p>
